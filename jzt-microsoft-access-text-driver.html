                            <p> I feel I've seen people ask about this a few times. So I took some code I found on this subreddit and elsewhere online and created a macro which allows you to do this. This macro works by prompting you to select a CSV file in a dialog box. Once the file is selected, the file path is returned by a function to the macro for additional processing. An inputbox is opened allowing you to enter a SQL statement (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, etc.) With the SQL statement, the CSV is processed and opened When I run the following set of lines, I get two different answers based on which conda env I'm currently working on. import pyodbc pyodbc.drivers() The environment is a 2.7 32bit environment I'm using to automate some of my company's reporting whereas the root is a 2.7 64bit environment. The list when I run it in the root environment is my regular list of ODBC drivers when I go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\ODBC\ODBCINST.INI but I have no idea how the environment list is populated. #Feedback, Bug Report The Division 2 Launch is finally here and it is also your opportunity to give feedback.

Every year or so, I tell myself that it's time to give Linux a serious try. This year, I decided to make a serious effort. I picked Ubuntu really just because I knew it existed and figured it was as good as any for getting familiar with the OS, especially for someone coming from Windows. I thought my experience might be useful for others contemplating such a move and particularly for helping to shape one's expectations. tl;dr - it works well, but it doesn't "just work." It takes. Hello For the past few days i have had some random bsod´s in my system all of drivers are updated but still i have bsod usually the bug check string is ntoskrnl.exe page\_fault\_in\_nonpaged\_area here is the dmp run through windbg here is the memory dmp file also : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oqNn4k7anwqhW38MM\_W3ZUVeBsQ4RGgc/view?usp=sharing (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oqNn4k7anwqhW38MM_W3ZUVeBsQ4RGgc/view?usp=sharing). 
I’ve been dealing with an issue with WMR and my Dell Visor the last couple of days. While playing DCS in VR, the game crashed back to desktop and the WMR Portal told me that my USB port was not a USB 3.0 port. Obviously, this couldn’t be true. I have been enjoying the Dell Visor for the past year without issue. No amount of unplugging and replugging the Dell Visor would solve it. I tried every USB 3.0 and USB 3.1 port on my PC. Front and back. With extensions and without. I tried. Backstory: I was hired full time hourly to an industrial psychologist’s office about a month and a half ago to work the help desk at a medium sized company in a relatively small state. The pay is high for my area, and during the interview process I was told our Director of IT worked mostly remotely but was available at all times. I’ve been at the help desk since middle school (just graduated university in January), and the office seemed pretty put together. During the second interview Just got the game cant even open it because it crashes constantly. Here is the crash log: \# \# A fatal error has been detected by the Java Runtime Environment: \# \# EXCEPTION\_ACCESS\_VIOLATION (0xc0000005) at pc=0x00000000649401b2, pid=6448, tid=7296 \# \# JRE version: Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (8.0\_51-b16) (build 1.8.0\_51-b16) \# Java VM: Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (25.51-b03 mixed mode windows-amd64 compressed oops) \# Problematic frame: \# C \ atio6. tl;dr: this is not adaptive brightness, but adaptive contrast , so follow this link: https://www.windowscentral.com/how-disable-adapative-contrast-surface (https://www.windowscentral.com/how-disable-adapative-contrast-surface) Also check this out (thanks u/vitaminjuk) in case you prefer a script for this, and especially if you have a surface Go (slightly different instructions): https://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/asxyln/easily\_disableenable\_intel\_display\_power\_saving/ (https://.

Hello, I have been experiencing a crashing problem the last 4-5 days with ROE. typically the game crashes right as i am coming into a map (right after you pick spawn location) then if i reload ROE it will let me back into the match only to crash a minute or two later. So far i have tried the following; 1) complete uninstall of ROE from steam (include deleting old folders) and then re-install 2) update all drivers on pc. 3) Run everything in admin 
Not sure if this is the right place to post this. Below is an assignment from an Operating Systems class I recently took. We were asked to compare/contrast some of the differences between two different Operating Systems. For extra credit, we were asked to post on a blog or an online resource.

Hey guys, Maybe some of you experienced something similar before and can help with this. so a co-worker (and friend) called me today with an issue I've never encountered before. When he prints a 2-page Word document, the printer takes \~45 minutes to print. When his wife prints the document (different laptop), it gets printed immediately. The printer is an Canon Maxify MB5050 (Multifunction-Printer with Ink-Cartridges), which is out of Magenta currently.

_Making the most out of MacOS Mojave_  Since friends and family have been asking me about setting up their new Macs, I figured I’d compile some of the stuff that I do/like/use for anybody wandering in from a Google search, or just from /r/all. I spend a lot of time using my Mac, so I hunt down lots of little things.  1. Browsing: The bulk of my peers spend their computer time browsing the web and consuming media. It’s great that we have lots of options in terms of maximizing batte. The Wine development release 3.20 is now available. https://www.winehq.org/announce/3.20 What's new in this release (see below for details): - Async interfaces and ACF files in the IDL compiler. - Support for substorage transforms in MSI. - RPC/COM marshalling fixes. - Support for Unicode requests in WinHTTP. - Shell Autocomplete optimizations. - Various bug fixes. The source is available Hello Redditors in Linux\_Gaming section! At first I would like to apologize for any mistakes in this text (English is not my native language) and also it’s length. I am really curious what do you think about my predictions of Linux growing up as a platform for Gamers. We have all seen how Valve is supporting gaming on Linux for long time.

Newly supported titles include not just one, but two Nintendo Game Watch classics: Donkey Kong and Green House, and the HP 9825B desktop computer. We’ve added dozens of new versions of supported systems, including European bootlegs of Puck Man, Ms. Pac-Man, Phoenix, Pengo and Zero Time, more revisions of Street Fighter II and Super Street. </p>
