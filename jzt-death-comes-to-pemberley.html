                            <p> It's a continuation of sorts of Pride and Prejudice  Reviews are running the gamut, so far. I'm a James fan but wonder if this might be too big of a departure from her usual. Not necessary a sequel or prequel or authorised by the publishers/author of the first book. Also, what are some good books like these. I think I've been spoiled with the Joe Wright version of Pride and Prejudice  No one else is Elizabeth but Keira Knightley. I saw another version of it yesterday and it was so wooden it was painful. 
I may have jumped to erroneous conclusions. This is somewhat of a continuation of Pride and Prejudice  Darcy and Lizzie have been married for a few years. Jane and Bingley live fairly close and Mr. and Mrs. Wickham are not welcome on the property. One dark and stormy night there is a murder in the Pemberley woods and the truth of what happened must be discovered. I have to confess I was somewhat disappointed. While James does an acceptable job of aping Austen's voice she robbed Lizzie of her spark, strength, and humor. She's reduced. I recently watched a series on Netflix, "Death Comes to Pemberley" and during the scenes that take place in the courtroom, I noticed an interesting feature: what looks to be a decanter of something on the judge's bench. Here's the clearest photo I could find of the drink ( Although in this frame there's nothing in the drinking glass, in other scenes there is. To me the liquid in question looks like brandy or some other type of alcohol. I assume some historical. Hello everyone! I am currently starting my thesis on adaptations of Pride and Prejudice . Currently I am working with The Lizzie Bennet Diaries , Death Comes to Pemberley , and possibly Bridget Jones's Diary . That being said, I am looking for the adaptations that you guy think are the best. Anything helps, I'm just trying to get a feel for what the fans like. Even if you cant choose, dislikes work too. Thanks Just read PD James's Death Comes to Pemberley. Hi everyone! My mother is a huge fan of Jane Austen and Pride and Prejudice in particular and Colin Firth as mr. Darcy in further particular. Every year for christmas I get her a gift that has something to do with Pride and Prejudice and after all these years the pile of good gifts is starting to wear thin. I wanted to ask you all if you had any good suggestions for books, DVD's or something similar that is linked to Pride and Prejudice. I live in the Netherlands, so it must be something that'. Have Trying to watch Death comes to Pemberley but every time I see her I feel Matt Smith will pop up and start spouting on about time and space. Hi! I was wondering if you guys to tell me what top 6 books you would read out of this list! Fun og light books would be greatly appreciated but of course I won't say no to a masterpiece!
